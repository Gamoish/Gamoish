# 🌟 Ayush Kumar

**Hey there! I’m Ayush — a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student at NMIT, Bangalore.**

I love building things that start as ideas and grow into complete projects.  
Whether it’s Python tools, game prototypes, AI experiments, or content systems — if something sparks my curiosity, I’ll build it.

I’m passionate about **AI/ML, game development, UI/UX, and creative engineering**, and I’m always exploring new technologies to sharpen my craft.

Alongside development, I work as a **Content Manager**, helping creators grow their digital presence through strategy, edits, and consistent execution.  
Tech + Creativity is where I feel at home.
